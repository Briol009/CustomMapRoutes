    "# Advanced Geocomputing Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customized Personal Route Creation Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By Laure Briol with the assistance of Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "My final project for Advanced Geocomputing (GEOG 5543) aimed to create a personalized routing service. This routing service enabled a user to visit all locations, while being able to avoid designated areas on a map and while minimizing their travel time. The project's initial scope focused on how to improve a shopping trip/experience. Using the tool, a user can go to multiple store locations, without backtracking on their drive. A user can choose multiple store location's and then be given the optimal route to reach each destination. There are some areas a user may want to avoid and the personal route creation tool takes these preferences into account, in order to improve the overall shopping experience. Therefore, the route creation tool implemented a feature, which allowed for a user to draw polygon areas that the routing service will avoid, when planning the route.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a goal to try out alternative services other than the expensive Google API’s, when implementing this project. To do this, there is a website called https://openrouteservice.org/, which has an open source API that is able to provide routing services for free. An added benefit of this service is that a user can state which locations they want to avoid and the API will automatically avoid them when creating the best route.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is an interactive map, meaning it cannot split into multiple pieces. Instead, the code is organized into these sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1: Global Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This section contains all the code that is repetitively called in the program.\n",
    "* This includes setting up the API key, colors for the map markers, lists to store the locations of the stops, and setting up an empty default map. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2: Avoid area polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "* This section contains code designed for prepping the 'avoiding areas polygon' feature.\n",
    "* This section adds in the map control button to draw a polygon. When the polygon is drawn, the polygon is added to a list of locations and is displayed on the map. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3: Adding locations\n",
    "\n",
    "* This section contains code designed for adding new locations onto the map.\n",
    "* This section adds in the button to enable adding locations and also adds the button to turn on ‘add new locations’.\n",
    "* Also included in this section is the checkbox option to ‘return to start’.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 4: Saving/loading map data\n",
    "\n",
    "* This section contains code designed for saving data from the map and then loading said data onto the map.\n",
    "* This section adds the buttons and text box to save data and load data. Additionally, this section implements the feature to save the data to a json file when the save button is clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 5: Optimizing route\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is the largest section of the code. This section creates an optimized route for the person to follow.\n",
    "* This section is run when the user clicks the ‘run optimization’ button.\n",
    "* The function starts by running a function called get_time_matrix_with_avoid to create a ‘time matrix’, calculating the time it takes to go between all point pair permutations.\n",
    "* OR tools is used to optimize the route between the two locations. This required the data to be re-adjusted to its own special format, which ChatGPT shared how to do. Then, ‘parameters’/settings were enabled for doing the optimization algorithms.\n",
    "* Once the OR tools finds the best route between all the locations, the program then updates the colors of markers to better indicate the order in which a person is traveling.\n",
    "* The openrouteservice API is also called to give the proper step by step directions for each ‘leg’ of the journey between two points.\n",
    "    * The program keeps track of the total amount of time traveled, based on the step by step travel times and travel distances.\n",
    "    * The API also shares the polyline for each leg, so that is displayed on the map as well.\n",
    "* The program finally prints out the step by step directions and total travel times at the bottom of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a final interactive map that can be used to create a custom route. There are buttons and a text input box at the top for saving & loading existing map json features. Below that, there is a button to toggle, which enables the user to add new points to the map and a checkbox to enable a user to return to the start point. The map itself is then displayed and has the option to draw a polygon area for avoiding features (when the 'Add Locations' is toggled to off). An 'Optimize Routes' button is displayed at the bottom of the screen. When the optimize routes button is clicked, the program will find the best route and display it on the map, as well as print step-by-step directions below the map display."
